# Women in Computing Point System

As many of you know, attendance to WiC events will now contribute to decisions regarding GHC funding from Northwestern. We want to clarify what events count towards GHC and which won’t. All social events put on by WiC that you attend will give you one point (It will only count if the event has a check-in form and you fill it out). However, if there are events put on by other organizations that we advertise but not sponsor, these will not count towards GHC.

If you volunteer with WiC through our community outreach chair, you get two points. If you’re actively participating in our mentorship program, you get 0.5 point. Please remember these points will only be a small part of the application and will not be the only factor being taken under consideration. The main purpose of our events is still to provide resources and community to our members, and hope that remains the motivation for attendance!

As always, feel free to reach out to anyone on the exec board if you have any questions. If you have any specific concerns please reach out to our presidents: Anna Deng (annadeng2020@u.northwestern.edu) or Suzy Lee (sujunglee2020@u.northwestern.edu).
